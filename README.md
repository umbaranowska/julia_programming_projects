[WORK IN PROGRESS] Learning Julia 1.x with "Julia Programming Projects" by Adrian Salceanu


Time to learn another programming language!  

I started with [Julia Scientific Programming](https://www.coursera.org/learn/julia-programming) on Coursera and then moved on to ["Julia Programming Projects"](https://www.packtpub.com/product/julia-programming-projects/9781788292740) by Adrian Salceanu. I am going to use this repository as a place to share my learning progress and small exercises / projects I will be coding in Julia along the way.
